# Hi, I'm Ben Sivan 👋

**Data Scientist | Bioinformatician | AgTech & FoodTech Specialist**

I bridge the gap between biology and computation. My work focuses on building infrastructure for scientific research, automating complex biological workflows, and creating high-performance tools for 3D modeling and knowledge management.

### 🚀 What I'm Building
*   **[Luametry](https://github.com/BenSiv/luametry)**: A professional, programmatic CAD tool for Lua, supporting STEP, 3MF, and OBJ exports with high-fidelity terminal previews.
*   **[Brain-ex](https://github.com/BenSiv/brain-ex)**: A terminal-first "second brain" for rapid note capture and task management, featuring optional Obsidian integration.
*   **[Luam](https://github.com/BenSiv/luam)**: A modernized, minimal Lua dialect designed for cleaner syntax and less boilerplate.
*   **Celleste-Expert**: A RAG-based AI agent for scientific literature mining and protocol extraction from unstructured text.
